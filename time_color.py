#NOTE: Format of collors are RRGGBBWW, if a value other than 00 is assigned to WW
#       Then the bulb will only show white. I think that ff is full brightness and 00
#       is off. You should use values like 000000ff. See speed_color.py for example
#       on having a range of values. or do it your own way.
